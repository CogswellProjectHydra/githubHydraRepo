[DONE] Introduce a "projects" table into the database and add a "project"
column to the other Hydra tables, which must be a foreign key into the
"projects" table.

	-	[DONE] Add a drop-down menu to FarmView->ThisNode with a list of
		projects that are available to choose from. On selection, spawn a YesNo
		dialog which asks if the user would like to switch the node to the new
		project selection. If Yes, update the project entry for that node in the
		database. After the choice has been made, spawn an information dialog
		which informs the user of the effects of their decision.

	-	[DONE] Add a drop-down menu to SubmitterMain which allows the user to
		choose which project their render job will be part of. The drop-down
		selection defaults to their render node's current project setting.

[DONE?] kill an entire job and all of its subtasks (even ones that are running)
	Problems:
		1. It can only talk to nodes if the hostnames are correct relative to
	   	   the local machine.
		2. Sometimes the nodes don't seem to get the message.


-find out what the problem is with the Questions import and fix it

-Jobs should have user names so that we know who submitted them.

-Users should be able to read the log files remotely [IN PROGRESS]

-add a "heartbeat" column to Hydra_rendernode [IN PROGRESS]

[DONE] farmview only runs on machines that have been registered (we should fix
that)

[DONE] column in farmview/joblisttest that shows how long it's been since it
started

-drop the tables in hydraDB and make an exact copy of hydraTest's tables under
hydraDB
	-update hydraSettings.cfg on all render nodes to use hydraDB instead of
	hydraTest.

-update 211-10A and 211-14A to have .cpc.local on their hostnames and in their

JobList Tasks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-we wish we had a button where, when a TASK is selected, it will resurrect the
task

-we might want something where you can select a job, give a condition, and
resurrect the tasks that meet that condition [IN PROGRESS]
(developing a search dialog which finds tasks meeting certain conditions)

[DONE] be able to sort tasks by column

-be able to select tasks by check box (insert checkboxes into QItemWidgets?)

-be able to do resubmit/kill operation on selected tasks
