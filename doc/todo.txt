1) Introduce a "projects" table into the database and add a "project" column
to the other Hydra tables, which must be a foreign key into the "projects"
table.
	a)	[DONE] Add a drop-down menu to FarmView->ThisNode with a list of
		projects that are available to choose from. On selection, spawn a YesNo
		dialog which asks if the user would like to switch the node to the new
		project selection. If Yes, update the project entry for that node in the
		database. After the choice has been made, spawn an information dialog
		which informs the user of the effects of their decision.

	b)	Add a drop-down menu to SubmitterMain which allows the user to choose
		which project their render job will be part of. (machines should have
		a default project stored in their local config file)

2) find out what the problem is with the Questions import and fix it

3) make a render calculator that, given an estimate in minutes-per-frame, can
tell user roughly how long it should take given the batch size they're using

[DONE?] kill an entire job and all of its subtasks (even ones that are running)
	Problems:
		1. It can only talk to nodes if the hostnames are correct relative to
	   	   the local machine.
		2. Sometimes the nodes don't seem to get the message.
