- kill an entire job and all of its subtasks (even ones that are running)

update: it works, sorta. it correctly kills all Ready tasks for a specified job,
but has issues with killing jobs that are running. it can only talk to nodes if
the hostnames are correct relative to the local machine. the other issue is that
sometimes the nodes don't seem to get the message, or for some reason they're
not responding.

- display the jobs/tasks nicely in a GUI so that the user can select a job to
kill
