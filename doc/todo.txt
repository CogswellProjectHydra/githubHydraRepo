1) [DONE] remove batch size spinner in favor of number of machines spinner, make
corresponding fix in MayaJobTicket (or wherever the render tasks are created.)
Fix the tab order of the number entry boxes.

2) [DONE] recompile submitterMain version 004, relaxing the restriction on
mapped drives.

3) [DONE] instead of insisting that the scene file live in a scenes folder to
deduce the project path, instead walk up the tree until the workspace.mel file
is found. That folder is the project path.

4) find out what the problem is with the Questions import and fix it

5) make a render calculator that, given an estimate in minutes-per-frame, can
tell user roughly how long it should take given the batch size they're using

[DONE] kill an entire job and all of its subtasks (even ones that are running)
	Problems:
		1. It can only talk to nodes if the hostnames are correct relative to
	   	   the local machine.
		2. Sometimes the nodes don't seem to get the message.

[DONE] display the jobs/tasks nicely in a GUI so that the user can select a job
to kill

[DONE] Make it so every app gets its own log file
