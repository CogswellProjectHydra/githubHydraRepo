- kill an entire job and all of its subtasks (even ones that are running)

update: it works, sorta. it correctly kills all Ready tasks for a specified job,
but has issues with killing jobs that are running. it can only talk to nodes if
the hostnames are correct relative to the local machine. the other issue is that
sometimes the nodes don't seem to get the message, or for some reason they're
not responding.

- display the jobs/tasks nicely in a GUI so that the user can select a job to
kill [it works]

-make a render calculator that, given an estimate in minutes-per-frame, can
tell user roughly how long it should take given the batch size they're using

-Make it so everybody gets their own logger. The way it works is you do
"from logging import logger" and you get this global logger object for your
whole application. the trick is, you have to set it up with a file path that
belongs to your program. but i guess it can do that for you! [DONE]

-Database objects have a db attribute and a cur attribute... make sure those
don't try to get written into the database! (in MySQLSetup.update)
